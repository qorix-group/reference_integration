# Eclipse S-CORE Reference Integration

This workspace integrates multiple Eclipse S-CORE modules (baselibs, communication, persistency, kyron, etc.) to validate cross-repository builds and detect integration issues early in the development cycle.

## Overview

The reference integration workspace serves as a unified Bazel build environment for:

- Validating cross-module dependency graphs and boundary issues
- Testing toolchain and platform support (Linux x86_64, QNX x86_64, Elektrobit corbos Linux aarch64, Red Hat AutoSD)
- Running Feature Integration Tests (FIT) and Integration Test Framework (ITF) tests
- Preparing for release validation and integration workflows

For additional documentation covering repository workflows and platform-specific details, see the `docs/` directory.

## Prerequisites

Install required system packages before building or running anything in this repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler libclang-dev lcov qemu-system-x86
```

For Docker, follow the [official Docker Engine install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Quick Start

Simply run:

```bash
./score_starter
```

You will be guided interactively through available integrations, build options, and examples to run.

## Run showcases

Use the interactive helper or Bazel to run showcase binaries. Examples:

```bash
# Interactive helper
./score_starter

# Run a CLI showcase (example target, may vary by workspace state)
bazel run //showcases/cli:cli -- --help
```

See [showcases/cli/README.md](showcases/cli/README.md) for CLI configuration and examples.

## Build and deploy showcases on Raspberry Pi (QNX aarch64)

The `images/qnx_aarch64` image packages all S-CORE showcases into a bootable QNX 8.0 IFS (Image File System) for AArch64 targets. It can be run in QEMU for local development and testing, or deployed to a Raspberry Pi 4/5 for real hardware validation.

### Prerequisites

- **QNX SDP 8.0.0** — a licensed copy of the QNX Software Development Platform is required for cross-compilation. See the [QNX SDP product page](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/foundation-software/qnx-software-development-platform).
- For RPi hardware: a **Raspberry Pi** (4 or later), microSD card, and the [QNX Raspberry Pi BSP](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/) — consult the BSP documentation for model-specific support and requirements.

### Build the QNX aarch64 image

Cross-compile all showcases and assemble the IFS image:

```bash
bazel build --config=qnx-aarch64 //images/qnx_aarch64:image
```

The built IFS image is written to:

```
bazel-bin/images/qnx_aarch64/build/init
```

### Run in QEMU (development and testing)

Before deploying to hardware, validate the image in QEMU:

```bash
bazel run --config=qnx-aarch64 //images/qnx_aarch64:run
```

SSH into the running QEMU instance (no password required):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
```

The showcases CLI starts automatically on boot. You can also launch it manually:

```bash
/showcases/bin/cli
```

### Flash QNX on Raspberry Pi

> [!NOTE]
> The default `images/qnx_aarch64` image uses `startup-virt`, which is suitable for QEMU. Deploying to real RPi hardware requires replacing this with the board-specific startup binary from the QNX Raspberry Pi BSP. See the `TODO` comment in [`images/qnx_aarch64/build/init.build`](images/qnx_aarch64/build/init.build).

General steps to create a bootable QNX SD card for Raspberry Pi:

1. **Obtain the QNX Raspberry Pi BSP** from [BlackBerry QNX](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/sdp8) and follow its *Getting Started* guide to install it under your QNX SDP.

2. **Replace the startup binary** in `images/qnx_aarch64/build/init.build`: substitute `startup-virt` with the RPi-specific startup binary provided by the BSP (consult the BSP documentation for the correct binary name for your RPi model).

3. **Rebuild the image** (see [Build the QNX aarch64 image](#build-the-qnx-aarch64-image) above).

4. **Prepare the SD card** following the QNX BSP instructions. This typically involves creating a boot partition and copying the QNX IFS image to it:

   ```bash
   # Copy the IFS image to the SD card boot partition (exact path depends on your BSP layout)
   cp bazel-bin/images/qnx_aarch64/build/init /media/$USER/boot/qnx-image.ifs
   sync && umount /media/$USER/boot
   ```

5. **Insert the SD card** into the RPi and power it on. QNX boots and starts all services defined in [`images/qnx_aarch64/configs/startup.sh`](images/qnx_aarch64/configs/startup.sh).

### Deploy and run showcases on Raspberry Pi

Once QNX is running on the RPi:

1. **Find the RPi IP address** — the system acquires an address via DHCP on the `vtnet0` interface at startup (configured in [`configs/network_setup_dhcp.sh`](images/qnx_aarch64/configs/network_setup_dhcp.sh)). Check your router's DHCP table or connect a serial console to read the address from the boot log.

2. **SSH into the RPi** (root, no password — see [`configs/sshd_config`](images/qnx_aarch64/configs/sshd_config)):

   ```bash
   ssh root@<RPi_IP>
   ```

3. **Showcases are pre-loaded** in `/showcases/bin/`. The interactive CLI is started automatically on boot (see [`configs/startup.sh`](images/qnx_aarch64/configs/startup.sh)). Re-launch it at any time:

   ```bash
   /showcases/bin/cli
   ```

4. **Run a specific showcase** by following the CLI prompts, or invoke a binary directly. For example, to run the lifecycle management example (from [`showcases/simple_lifecycle`](showcases/simple_lifecycle)):

   ```bash
   /showcases/bin/launch_manager
   ```

5. **View system logs**:

   ```bash
   slog2info
   ```

## Run tests

Run Feature Integration Tests (FIT) and Integration Test Framework (ITF) with Bazel. Common examples:

```bash
# Run all FIT tests (Rust + C++)
bazel test --config=linux-x86_64 //feature_integration_tests/test_cases:fit --test_output=streamed

# Run only Rust scenarios listing
bazel run //feature_integration_tests/test_scenarios/rust:rust_test_scenarios -- --list-scenarios

# Run ITF tests on Docker (Linux)
bazel test --config=linux-x86_64 //feature_integration_tests/itf --test_output=streamed

# Run ITF tests on QNX (uses the itf-qnx-x86_64 test config)
bazel test --config=itf-qnx-x86_64 //feature_integration_tests/itf --test_output=streamed
```

Notes:
- Use `--config=<name>` to select the correct toolchain/platform (supported configs for tests: `linux-x86_64`, `qnx-x86_64`). See `.bazelrc` for all available configs.
- For streaming test output and real-time logs, use `--test_output=streamed` or `--test_output=all`.

## Multi-Module Development Workspace

For cross-module development, you can obtain a complete S-CORE workspace—a local git checkout of all modules pinned in `known_good.json` on specific branches/commits—integrated into a single Bazel build.

This enables:
- Cross-module development and debugging
- Testing changes across multiple modules simultaneously
- Reproducible builds with pinned versions

> [!NOTE]
> The [S-CORE devcontainer](https://github.com/eclipse-score/devcontainer) [integrated in this repository](.devcontainer/) pre-installs workspace managers and generates required metadata.
> Manual setup is also possible; see `.devcontainer/prepare_workspace.sh` for the setup script.

### Initialization Steps

1. **Switch to local path overrides:**
   
   Use the VS Code Task (`Terminal` → `Run Task...`): **"Switch Bazel modules to `local_path_overrides`"**
   
   Command line:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/known_good/update_module_from_known_good.py --override-type local_path
   ```
   
   To revert to git overrides:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/known_good/update_module_from_known_good.py --override-type git
   ```

2. **Update workspace metadata from known good:**
   
   Use the VS Code Task: **"Update workspace metadata from known good"**
   
   Command line:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/known_good/known_good_to_workspace_metadata.py
   ```

3. **Clone all modules:**
   
   Use the VS Code Task: **"Gita: Generate workspace"**
   
   Command line (using gita):
   ```bash
   gita clone --preserve-path --from-file .gita-workspace.csv
   ```

Modules are cloned into subdirectories prefixed with `score_` (e.g., `score_persistency/`, `score_communication/`).

When running Bazel, it will use these local working copies, and your changes will be immediately reflected in the next build.

## Known Issues ⚠️

For a comprehensive list of known issues, limitations, and troubleshooting guidance, see the `docs/` directory.

### Communication Module

**Module:** `score/mw/com/requirements`

**Integration issues when building from external repository:**

1. **Label inconsistency**: Some `BUILD` files use `@//third_party` instead of `//third_party` (repository-qualified vs. local labels). Should standardize on local labels.
2. **Outdated path reference**: `runtime_test.cpp:get_path` checks for obsolete `safe_posix_platform` instead of the current module path structure.

## IDE Support

### Rust

To enable VS Code Rust analyzer support:

```bash
scripts/generate_rust_analyzer_support.sh
```

This generates the necessary Rust analyzer configuration for the workspace.

## Internal Tooling

Internal tooling scripts are currently under development to provide a unified interface for repository operations.

For detailed documentation, see [scripts/tooling/README.md](scripts/tooling/README.md).
