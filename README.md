# Score Reference Integration

This workspace integrates multiple Eclipse Score modules (baselibs, communication, persistency, orchestrator, feo, etc.) to validate cross-repository builds and detect integration issues early in the development cycle.

## Overview

The reference integration workspace serves as a single Bazel build environment to:
- Validate cross-module dependency graphs
- Detect label and repository boundary issues
- Test toolchain and platform support (Linux, QNX, LLVM/GCC)
- Prepare for release validation workflows


## Structure

Repository structure

```
- bazel_common
- showcases
- images
   - image1
      - showcases (symlink to ../../showcases)
      - bazel_common (symlink to ../../bazel_common)
      - runners
         - runner1 (symlink to ../../../runners/runner1)
   - image2
      ...
- runners
   - runner1
   - runner2
```

The basic idea is that we use `symlinks` to share all common functionalities to achieve `DRY` rule.

### bazel_common
Used to keep a common bazel functionalities for `images` like:
- toolchain setups
- common tooling deps
- common S-CORE modules deps
- common `.bzl` extensions needed to streamline images


### showcases
Used to keep `S-CORE` wide **showcases** implementation to showcase S-CORE in certain deployments (images). Contains:
- proxy target bundling all `standalone` examples from all `S-CORE` repos to deploy then as single bazel target into image
- implementation of certain **showcases** that shall be deployed into images


### images
Used to keep concrete `images` for given target platform as bazel modules. Each platform shall have it's own folder with name `{platform}_{arch}` ie. `qnx_aarch64`.

This `images` shall:
 - symlink other shared folders (`bazel_common`, `showcases`) to receive common functionality.
 - symlink supported `runner` (if any)
 - deploy all `usecases` into image so they can be run inside
 - other specific code for given `image`

### runners
Used to keep thin logic ro reuse `runners` between images, like docker runner etc.





## Docs

To generate a full documentation of all integrated modules, run:
```bash
bazel run //:docs_combo_experimental
```
## Working Builds ✅

The following modules build successfully with the `x86_64-linux` configuration:

### Baselibs
```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_baselibs//score/... --verbose_failures
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_baselibs//score/... --verbose_failures
```

### Communication
```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_communication//score/mw/com:com --verbose_failures
```

### Persistency
```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux \
  @score_persistency//src/cpp/src/... \
  @score_persistency//src/rust/... \
  --verbose_failures
```

> Note: Python tests for `@score_persistency` cannot be built from this integration workspace due to Bazel external repository visibility limitations. The pip extension and Python dependencies must be accessed within their defining module.

### Orchestration and `kyron` - async runtime for Rust

```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_orchestrator//src/...
```

## Feature showcase examples
The examples that are aiming to showcase features provided by S-CORE are located in `feature_showcase` folder.
You can run them currently for host platform using `--config x86_64-linux`.

Execute `bazel query //feature_showcase/...` to obtain list of targets that You can run.


```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_orchestrator//src/... --verbose_failures
```

## Operating system integrations

> [!NOTE]
> Integrations of Eclipse S-CORE into reference operating systems are currently realized as **independent Bazel projects**.
> Please refer to the README documents in the respective sub-directories for details about the specific integration.

* [QNX](./qnx_qemu/README.md)
* [Red Hat AutoSD](./autosd/build/README.md)
* [Elektrobit corbos Linux for Safety Applications](./ebclfsa/README.md)

## Workspace support

You can obtain a complete S-CORE workspace, i.e. a git checkout of all modules from `known_good.json`, on the specific branches / commits, integrated into one Bazel build.
This helps with cross-module development, debugging, and generally "trying out things".

> [!NOTE]
> The startup of the [S-CORE devcontainer](https://github.com/eclipse-score/devcontainer) [integrated in this repository](.devcontainer/) already installs supported workspace managers and generates the required metadata.
> You can do this manually as well, of course (e.g. if you do not use the devcontainer).
> Take a look at `.devcontainer/prepare_workspace.sh`, which contains the setup script.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Bazel targets are supported yet.
> Running `./scripts/integration_test.sh` will work, though.
> Take a look at the [Known Issues](#known-issues-️) below to see which Bazel targets are available and working.

The supported workspace managers are:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Gita](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita) | "a command-line tool to manage multiple git repos" |

A description of how to use these workspace managers, together with their advantages and drawbacks, is beyond the scope of this document.
In case of doubt, choose the first.

### Initialization of the workspace

> [!WARNING]
> This will change the file `score_modules.MODULE.bazel`.
> Do **not** commit these changes!

1. Switch to local path overrides, using the VSCode Task (`Terminal`->`Run Task...`) "Switch Bazel modules to `local_path_overrides`".
   Note that you can switch back to `git_overrides` (the default) using the task "Switch Bazel modules to `git_overrides`"
   
2. Run VSCode Task "&lt;Name&gt;: Generate workspace", e.g. "Gita: Generate workspace".
   This will clone all modules using the chosen workspace manager.
   The modules will be in sub-directories starting with `score_`.
   Note that the usage of different workspace managers is mutually exclusive.

When you now run Bazel, it will use the local working copies of all modules and not download them from git remotes.
You can make local changes to each module, which will be directly reflected in the next Bazel run.

## Known Issues ⚠️

### Orchestrator
**Issue:** Direct toolchain loading at `BUILD:14`
```
load("@score_toolchains_qnx//rules/fs:ifs.bzl", "qnx_ifs")
```
**Resolution needed:** Refactor to use proper toolchain resolution instead of direct load statements.

**Issue:** clang needs to be installed
```
sudo apt install clang
```
**Resolution needed:** why is this happening with -extra_toolchains=@gcc_toolchain//:host_gcc_12 ?

### Communication
**Module:** `score/mw/com/requirements`

**Issues when building from external repository:**
1. **Label inconsistency:** Some `BUILD` files use `@//third_party` instead of `//third_party` (repository-qualified vs. local label). Should standardize on local labels within the module.
2. **Outdated path reference:** `runtime_test.cpp:get_path` checks for `safe_posix_platform` (likely obsolete module name) instead of `external/score_communication+/`.

### Persistency
**Test failures in `src/cpp/tests`:**
1. **Dependency misconfiguration:** `google_benchmark` should not be a dev-only dependency if required by tests. Consider separating benchmark targets.
2. **Compiler-specific issue in `test_kvs.cpp`:** Contains GCC-specific self-move handling that is incorrect and fails with GCC (only builds with LLVM). Needs portable fix or removal of undefined behavior.

## Build Blockers 🚧

The following builds are currently failing:

### FEO (Full Build)
```bash
bazel build @feo//... --verbose_failures
```

### Persistency (Full Build)
```bash
bazel build --config x86_64-linux @score_persistency//src/... --verbose_failures
```

## System Dependencies

### Required Packages for FEO
Install the following system packages before building FEO:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler libclang-dev
```

## Pending Tasks 🧪

- [ ] Add test targets once cross-repository visibility constraints are clarified
- [ ] Normalize third-party label usage across all `BUILD` files
- [ ] Resolve FEO build failures
- [ ] Fix Persistency full build
- [ ] Address compiler-specific issues in test suites

## Proxy & External Dependencies 🌐

### Current Issue

The `starpls.bzl` file ([source](https://github.com/eclipse-score/tooling/blob/main/starpls/starpls.bzl)) uses `curl` directly for downloading dependencies, which:
- Bypasses Bazel's managed fetch lifecycle and dependency tracking
- Breaks reproducibility and remote caching expectations
- May fail in corporate proxy-restricted environments

### Workaround

Use a `local_path_override` and configure proxy environment variables before building:

```bash
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

Add this to your `MODULE.bazel`:
```python
local_path_override(module_name = "score_tooling", path = "../tooling")
```

### Suggested Improvements
- Replace raw `curl` calls with Bazel `http_archive` or `repository_ctx.download` for reproducibility.
- Parameterize proxy usage via environment or Bazel config flags.

## IDE support

### Rust

Use `scripts/generate_rust_analyzer_support.sh` to generate rust_analyzer settings that will let VS Code work.

## 🗂 Notes
Keep this file updated as integration issues are resolved. Prefer converting ad-hoc shell steps into Bazel rules or documented scripts under `scripts/` for repeatability.
