Security Analysis Work Products
###############################

.. workproduct:: Platform Security Analysis
   :id: wp__platform_security_analysis
   :status: valid
   :complies:

   Analyze the attack surfaces between features that references all platform feature
   static architecture diagrams, highlighting potential shared attack vectors.

.. workproduct:: Feature Security Analysis
   :id: wp__feature_security_analysis
   :status: draft
   :complies: std_wp__isosae21434__development_1055, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15631, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15731, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15831, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15931

   Bottom-Up Security Analysis with defined methods, verifies the feature architecture (as part of SW Security Concept)
   - Mitigations linked to Software Feature Requirements or Assumptions of Use

   Analyze the attack surfaces between modules/components that references all feature
   static architecture diagrams, highlighting potential shared attack vectors.

   Mitigations linked to Software Feature Security Requirements or Feature Assumptions of Use

   Perform analysis on interactions between security-relevant and non-security-relevant
   modules/components or modules/components with different security levels of one feature.

.. workproduct:: Component Security Analysis
   :id: wp__sw_component_security_analysis
   :status: draft
   :complies: std_wp__isosae21434__development_1055, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15631, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15731, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15831, std_wp__isosae21434__assessment_15931

   Bottom-Up Security Analysis with defined methods, verifies the component architecture (as part of SW Security Concept)
   - Mitigations linked to Software Component Requirements or Assumptions of Use

   Analyze the attack surfaces between sub-components, units that references all
   component static architecture diagrams, highlighting potential shared attack vectors.

   Mitigations linked to Software Component Security Requirements or Assumptions of Use

   Perform analysis of security-relevant and non-security-relevant sub-elements or
   sub-elements with different security levels.

   Perform analysis on interactions between security-relevant and non-security-relevant
   sub-components or sub-components with different security levels of one component.
   Including potential influences from the other components in the component's module.
