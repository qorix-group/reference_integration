Security Analysis threat scenarios
==================================

.. gd_guidl:: Security Analysis threat scenarios
  :id: gd_guidl__sec_ana_threat_scenarios
  :status: valid
  :complies:

.. note::
  Use all applicable threat scenarios to ensure a structured analysis. If there are
  additional threat scenarios needed, please enlarge the list of threat scenarios.

**Purpose**

In order to identify all potential security threats and attack vectors, which may
target your feature or components from the platform, other features, components, etc.,
use the following framework of threat scenarios to check your completeness of the
analysis.

Security Analysis threat scenarios
==================================

2.1 Attack surfaces

.. note::
  Attack surfaces are only to be considered if the feature and the related security
  controls are exposed through this specific interface. If the interface is not used
  by the feature or the related security controls, it is not an attack surface.

  Receiving function is affected by information that is spoofed, tampered, disclosed,
  or subjected to denial of service from the attacker.
