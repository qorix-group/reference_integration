.. gd_temp:: Software Development Plan Template
   :id: gd_temp__software_development_plan
   :status: draft
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__software_541

Purpose
+++++++

The main purpose of the software development plan is to define several software development related conditions:

* selection of design and programming language
* design guideline (e.g. Enforcement of low complexity, Use of naming conventions, etc)
* coding guideline (e.g. MISRA, can also include style guide or naming convention; Furthermore the coding guideline should respect the usual topics like Use of language subsets, Use of style guides, etc.)
* SW configuration guideline
* development tools

Objectives and Scope
++++++++++++++++++++

Objective is to define the main SW development policies as defined in the "Purpose" in an ISO 26262 and ASPICE compliant manner.
Scope is the complete SW platform and the development parts of the process.
