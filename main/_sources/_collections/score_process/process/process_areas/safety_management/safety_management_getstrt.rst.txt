.. doc_getstrt:: Getting started on Safety Management
   :id: doc_getstrt__safety_management_process
   :status: valid

This document describes the steps which need to be done to ensure Functional Safety according to ISO 26262 as used standard in the project.

Therefore guidelines :need:`gd_guidl__saf_plan_definitions`, :need:`gd_guidl__saf_man`, :need:`gd_guidl__saf_package`, :need:`gd_guidl__component_classification`
and a :need:`doc_concept__safety_management_process` are available.

General Workflow
****************

One goal of the Safety Management Process is to ensure that the project is following the defined processes and
that the evidence of Functional Safety can be shown according to the requirements. The Safety Management process
follows an continuous approach.

The workflows are defined in the :ref:`workflow_safety_management` section. The following workflows shall be executed continuously:

* Create/Maintain Safety Plan
* Create/Maintain Safety Package
* Create/Maintain Safety Manual
* Monitor/Verify Safety

Additional to the continuous workflows the following workflows shall be executed according to the project needs:

* Create Component Classification
* Perform Safety Audit
* Perform Formal Reviews
* Impact Analysis of Change Request

For open issues the issue tracking system is used to track the issues and to ensure that they are resolved in time.
The issue tracking system is defined in the :need:`wp__issue_track_system`.
