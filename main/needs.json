This check shall be supported by tooling.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_03\n     - Is the requirement description *atomic* ?\n     - A good way to think about this is to consider if the requirement may be tested by one (positive) test case or needs more of these. The sentence template should also avoid being non-atomic already. Note that there are cases where also non-atomic requirements are the better ones, for example if those are better understandable.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_04\n     - Is the requirement description *feasible* ?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection the requirement has already some implementation. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`gd_req__req_attr_impl` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. not implemented at least as \"proof-of-concept\"), a development expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_05\n     - Is the requirement description *independent from implementation* ?\n     - This checkpoint should improve requirements definition in the sense that the \"what\" is described and not the \"how\" - the latter should be described in architecture/design derived from the requirement. But there can also be a good reason for this, for example we would require using a file format like JSON and even specify the formatting standard already on stakeholder requirement level because we want to be compatible. A finding in this checkpoint does not mean there is a safety problem in the requirement.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_03_01\n     - For stakeholder requirements: Is the *rationale* correct?\n     - Rationales explain why the top level requirements were invented. Do those cover the requirement?\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_03_02\n     - For other requirements: Is the *linkage to the parent requirement* correct?\n     - Linkage to correct levels and ASIL attributes is checked automatically, but it needs checking if the child requirement implements (at least) a part of the parent requirement.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_04_01\n     - Is the requirement *internally and externally consistent*?\n     - Does the requirement contradict other requirements within the same or higher levels? One may restrict the search to the feature for component requirements, for features to other features using same components.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_05_01\n     - Do the software requirements consider *timing constraints of the parent requirement*?\n     - This bullet point encourages to think about timing constraints even if those are not explicitly mentioned in the parent requirement. If the reviewer of a requirement already knows or suspects that the implementation will be time consuming, one should think of the expectation of a \"user\".\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_06_01\n     - Does the Requirement consider *external interfaces*?\n     - The SW platform's external interfaces (to the user) are defined in the Feature Architecture, so the Feature and Component Requirements should determine the data consumed and set on these interfaces. Are output values completely defined?\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_07_01\n     - Is the *ASIL Attribute* set correctly?\n     - Derived requirements are checked automatically, see :need:`gd_req__req_linkage_safety`. But for the top level requirements this needs to be checked for correctness. Also AoU from external components need check for correct ASIL as those are the \"origin\" of safety requirements towards the SW platform.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_07_02\n     - Is the attribute *security* set correctly?\n     - Stakeholder requirements security attribute should be set based on Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) (process is TBD). Checklist item is supported by automated check: \"Every requirement which satisfies a requirement with security attribute set to YES inherits this\". Expectation is that the feature/component requirements/architecture may also be subject to a Software Security Criticality Analysis (process is TBD).\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_08_01\n     - Is the requirement *verifiable*?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection already tests are created for the requirement. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`gd_req__req_attr_test_covered` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. missing test cases), a test expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_09_01\n     - For stakeholder requirements: Do those cover assumed safety mechanisms needed by the hardware and system?\n     - Note that the feature/component requirements also cover safety mechanisms in case those are needed to mitigate failures found during :ref:`safety_analysis`\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_09_02\n     - For other requirements: Do the requirements defining a safety mechanism contain the error reaction leading to a safe state?\n     - Alternatively to the safe state there could also be \"repair\" mechanisms.

Security Culture is planned to grow in the SW platform. This shall be fostered by doing process conformance checks and work product reviews, as well as lessons learned\n| after each feature development completion and a process audit after each platform/project release. Delta audits allowed based on variation statement.\n| The main outcome is the :need:`wp__process_impr_report`, which is used to improve the processes for the platform/project.\n|\n| **Quality Management:**\n| ASPICE 4.0 standard is selected for quality management. Processes will always link to the :ref:`standard_iso26262` standard, :ref:`standard_isopas8926` standard, :ref:`standard_isosae21434` and to the `ASPICE 4.0 <https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/standards/aspice_40/aspice.html>`_ standard.\n|\n| **Communication:**\n| Cross functional teams are interdisciplinary, so the regular (sprint) planning and review meetings enable communication. The organization of the project is described in the Project Management Plan. Another main communication means are the Pull Request (PR) reviews.\n| Also the standard Eclipse Foundation communication strategies are used (e.g. mailing lists, messenger).\n|\n| **Quality issues, non-conformances and improvements:**\n| Feedback from the field, but also during development of change requests to existing features, bug reporting by the Open Source community or integration of existing SW components into new features may lead to the discovery of issues, non-conformances or improvements.\n| Non-conformance can also be deviations from the development process with impact on safety or security.\n| If these are known at the time of creation of a release they will be part of the :need:`wp__platform_sw_release_note` for the feature.\n| Other issues and non-conformances relevant for already delivered releases will be identified as such and communicated (as defined in Problem Resolution part of the Project Management Plan) via the :need:`wp__issue_track_system`.\n|\n| **Tailoring quality activities:**\n| Main tailoring driver is that the SW platform is pure SW development and is provided as \"SW element\" - this explains mainly the generic, platform wide tailoring.\n| Tailoring is done for the whole SW platform by defining only the relevant processes and their resulting outcomes and an argumentation why the others are not needed in `ASPICE 4.0 <https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/standards/aspice_40/aspice.html>`_.\n|\n| **Planning quality activities:**\n| In the Quality Management Plan the nomination of the :need:`rl__quality_manager` and the :need:`rl__project_lead` is documented.\n| The planning of quality activities is done using issues in the :need:`wp__issue_track_system` as specified in the Project Management part of the Project Management Plan.\n| It contains for each issue\n| * objective - as part of the issue description\n| * dependencies on other activities or information - by links to the respective issues\n| * responsible person for the activity - as issue assignee\n| * required resources for the activity - by selecting a team label (or \"project\") pointing to a team of committers dedicated to the issue resolution\n| * duration in time, including start and end point - by selecting a milestone\n| * UID of the resulting work products - stated in the issue title\n|\n| The planning of quality activities is part of\n| * generic planning, dealing with all work products needed only once for the platform. This is included in the Quality Management Platform Plan.\n|\n| **Planning supporting processes:**\n| Supporting processes (Requirements Management, Configuration Management, Change Management, Documentation Management, Tool Management) are planned within the Project Management Plan.\n|\n| **Planning integration and verification:**\n| Integration on the target hardware is not done in the scope of the SW platform project, but SW/SW integration up to the feature level is performed and its test results are part of the :need:`wp__verification_platform_ver_report`.\n| The integration on the target hardware, done by the distributor or OEM, is supported by delivering a set of HW/SW feature integration and Platform Integration Tests which were already run successfully on a reference HW platform.\n| This is planned by the respective workproducts:\n| * :need:`wp__verification_feat_int_test`\n| * :need:`wp__verification_platform_int_test`\n| Verification planning is documented in :need:`wp__verification_plan`\n|\n| **Scheduling of audits, conformance checks, work product reviews, release verification and approval:**\n| Scheduling is done in the same way as for all work products definition by issues. The respective work products are listed in :need:`doc_concept__wp_inspections`.\n|\n| **Planning quality trainings:**\n| Quality trainings are planned also by issues. They should cover the following aspects:\n| * Target audience\n| * Training objectives\n| * Training content\n| * Training schedule\n| * Responsible persons", "docname": "_collections/score_process/process/process_areas/quality_management/guidance/quality_plan_guideline", "external_css": "external_link", "id": "gd_guidl__qlm_plan_definitions", "is_modified": true, "layout": "score", "lineno": 20, "modifications": 1, "section_name": "Guideline Quality Management Plan", "sections": ["Guideline Quality Management Plan"], "status": "valid", "tags": ["quality_management"], "title": "Quality Management Plan Definitions Guideline", "type": "gd_guidl", "type_name": "Process Guideline"}, "gd_guidl__rel_management": {"complies": ["std_req__iso26262__management_64131", "std_req__iso26262__management_64132", "std_req__iso26262__management_64133", "std_req__iso26262__management_64134", "std_req__iso26262__management_64135"], "contains_back": ["wf__rel_mod_rel_note", "wf__rel_platform_rel_note", "wf__rel_mod_rel_plan", "wf__rel_plat_rel_plan"], "docname": "_collections/score_process/process/process_areas/release_management/guidance/release_guideline", "external_css": "external_link", "id": "gd_guidl__rel_management", "is_modified": true, "layout": "score", "lineno": 18, "modifications": 1, "section_name": "Guideline", "sections": ["Guideline"], "status": "valid", "tags": ["release_mgt"], "title": "Release Management Guideline", "type": "gd_guidl", "type_name": "Process Guideline"}, "gd_guidl__req_engineering": {"complies": ["std_req__isopas8926__44421", "std_req__isopas8926__44422", "std_req__isopas8926__44423"], "docname": "_collections/score_process/process/process_areas/requirements_engineering/guidance/requirements_guideline", "external_css": "external_link", "id": "gd_guidl__req_engineering", "is_modified": true, "layout": "score", "lineno": 18, "modifications": 2, "section_name": "Guideline", "sections": ["Guideline"], "status": "valid", "tags": ["requirements_engineering"], "title": "Requirements Guideline", "type": "gd_guidl", "type_name": "Process Guideline"}, "gd_guidl__req_tailored": {"complies": ["std_req__iso26262__system_6423", "std_req__iso26262__system_6424", "std_req__iso26262__system_6425", "std_req__iso26262__software_643", "std_req__iso26262__software_644", "std_req__iso26262__software_646"], "content": "This part of the guideline links to all the requirements which are not fulfilled by the\nrequirements engineering process.

    It should be adapted to the specific needs of project.\n\n\n     Purpose\n     =======\n\n     This section should briefly describe the overall goal of the verification plan.\n     It should state the plan's intended audience and the information it aims to provide.\n     This might include clarifying the scope of the verification activities and linking to\n     other relevant documents.\n\n\n     Objectives and Scope\n     ====================\n\n     Objectives\n     ----------\n\n     This section outlines the key objectives of the software verification effort.\n     Examples include correctness, completeness, reliability, performance, maintainability,\n     compliance, and traceability. Each objective should be clearly defined and measurable.\n\n     Verification Scope and Constraints\n     ----------------------------------\n\n     This section details what software components and functionalities are included in the\n     verification process. It should also clearly specify any limitations or exclusions.\n     This section should address external dependencies and integrations.\n\n\n     Risks and Mitigation\n     --------------------\n\n     This section identifies potential risks associated with the verification activities and outlines\n     strategies to mitigate those risks. This may involve referencing the :need:`wp__platform_mgmt`.\n\n\n     Schedules\n     ---------\n\n     This section defines the timeline for different verification activities.\n     It might include milestones, deadlines, and dependencies between tasks.\n\n\n     Approach\n     ========\n\n     General Approach\n     ----------------\n\n     This section provides a high-level overview of the verification strategy.\n     It should describe the overall methodology (e.g., Continuous Integration),\n     approaches used, and rationale behind the choices made.\n\n     Software Integration\n     --------------------\n\n     This section details how software components are integrated into the system.\n     It should describe the integration process, including procedures for handling new features,\n     bug fixes, and code changes.\n\n     Levels of Integration and Verification\n     --------------------------------------\n\n     This section defines the different levels of integration and verification that will be performed\n     (e.g., unit, component, system). Each level should be clearly defined, with associated criteria\n     for successful completion.\n\n     Verification Methods\n     --------------------\n\n     This section lists the specific verification methods used, such as static analysis,\n     dynamic testing, reviews, and inspections. Each method should be briefly described,\n     including its purpose and applicability at different levels of verification.\n     Reference tables can list methods, identifiers, applicable levels and ASIL relevance.\n\n     Test Derivation Methods\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n     This section details the techniques used to derive test cases (e.g., boundary value analysis,\n     equivalence partitioning, requirements tracing). It should clarify which techniques are used\n     at each level of testing and for different ASIL levels.  Again, a reference table is recommended.\n\n     Quality Criteria\n     ----------------\n\n     This section specifies the quality criteria that must be met for successful verification.\n     These criteria might include code coverage metrics, defect density, or other relevant measures.\n     The criteria should be defined with quantifiable goals for different ASIL levels.\n\n     Test Development\n     ----------------\n\n     This section describes the process for developing and maintaining test cases.\n     It should cover aspects such as test automation, test data management, and version control.\n\n     Pre-existing test cases\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     This section describes how pre-existing test cases are handled which are e.g. available\n     from an OSS component. It should be stated how they are reviewed, integrated, extended\n     (e.g. with respective documentation), and adopted to the needs described in the project\n     (e.g. usage of documentation templates and traceability)\n\n     Test Execution and Result Analysis\n     ----------------------------------\n\n     This section describes how tests will be executed and the procedures for analyzing the results.\n     It should outline the tools and processes used for test execution and reporting.\n\n     Test Selection and Regression Testing\n     -------------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the approach to selecting test cases for execution and the strategy for\n     regression testing to ensure that new changes don't introduce regressions.\n\n     Work Products and Traceability\n     ------------------------------\n\n     This section lists all the key deliverables related to the verification process.\n     It should also describe how traceability between requirements, design, code, and test\n     cases is maintained.\n\n\n     Environments and Resources\n     ==========================\n\n     Roles\n     -----\n\n     This section defines the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the\n     verification process. It can refer and should be based on the definition in the\n     verification process :ref:`verification_roles`.\n\n     Tools\n     -----\n\n     This section lists the tools used for verification, including build systems, test frameworks,\n     static analysis tools, and other relevant software.\n\n     Verification Setups and Variants\n     --------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the different test environments and configurations used for verification.\n\n     Test Execution Environment and Reference Hardware\n     -------------------------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the hardware and software environments used for test execution.\n     It should include information about any specific hardware platforms or simulators used.\n     It should also define how the verification environment interacts with the CI system, including\n     access control and maintenance.", "docname":
