| **Platform Release:** S-CORE
| **Release Tag:** v0.7.0
| **Origin Release Tag**: v0.6
| **Release Date:** 2026-05-11


Overview
^^^^^^^^

This document provides an overview of the changes, improvements, and bug fixes included in the software platform release version v0.7.0 as compared to the platform’s origin release (v0.6).

The SCORE 0.7 platform release centers on safety formalization (vulnerability management, OS tier definitions, safety manuals), Rust interoperability (FFI bindings in baselibs and a full Rust COM API in communication),
and infrastructure hardening (toolchain improvements, Dependabot, CodeQL).

Disclaimer
----------

This release note does not "release for production", as it does not come with a safety argumentation and a performed safety assessment.
The work products compiled in the safety package are created with care according to a process satisfying standards, but the as the project,
being a non-profit and open source organization, can not take over any liability for its content.

Changes to the Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Features
------------

No new features were added in this release.

Improvements
------------

The release significantly expanded integration testing capabilities, with ITF upgrade and test execution now supported on both Docker and QNX targets using the new py_itf_test Bazel rule.
The CI/CD pipeline was overhauled — the bash-based integration script was replaced with Python and the pipeline became more robust with improved build caching, automatic cancellation of superseded runs, and workflow steps pinned to exact commit SHAs for supply-chain safety.
EBcLfSA integration was updated to the new structure and extended with Rust application support.
On the documentation side, the build pipeline was fixed and an integration status dashboard was introduced to provide visibility into module health across the platform.
Infrastructure-wise, Bzlmod lockfile consistency is now enforced in CI, the AutoSD image version is frozen for reproducible builds, and image filesystem rules were migrated to the new Bazel API.
