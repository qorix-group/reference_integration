Reference Integration Documentation
===================================

The **Reference Integration** is the central integration repository of the
eclipse-score project. It combines all
S-CORE software modules — including Communication, Logging, Persistency,
Time, Config Management, Lifecycle, and Security/Crypto — into a
single, consistently versioned workspace.

Its purpose is to verify that all modules build, integrate, and pass their
tests together, providing a stable baseline for downstream projects. The
repository also hosts the consolidated documentation, verification reports,
and release notes for each S-CORE release.

Beyond validation, the **Reference Integration** also serves as a technical
blueprint for future commercial distributions. It demonstrates how S-CORE
modules can be combined into a coherent, releaseable platform baseline,
including the expected integration structure, verification artifacts, and
documentation set that downstream product distributions can build on.
