Step 4 — Get built and tested on the target platforms
=====================================================

.. admonition:: What it unlocks
   :class: tip

   **Target-platform builds & tests** — Your module is actually **compiled and
   tested by the pipelines** — built for and deployed to every target platform
   (Linux x86_64, QNX, AutoSD, EBcLfSA aarch64), offered in the interactive CLI,
   and exercised by CI. This is the rung that turns a library into something
   that *runs* inside the integration images.

The integration provides build definitions for four target images, each built
and tested by its own gating CI job — it does not distribute ready-to-flash
images; you build them yourself from these definitions. The table lists the
platforms, the image target, the runner used to execute it, and the per-platform
CI check.

.. note::

   The EB corbos *Safety Applications* image is special: it runs a
   high-integrity application demo under additional constraints. Read
   `images/ebclfsa_aarch64/README.md <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/images/ebclfsa_aarch64/README.md>`_
   before targeting it.

Run any image locally in QEMU
-----------------------------

Every image exposes a ``:run`` target that boots it in an emulator, so you can
try your module on the real target without hardware:

.. code-block:: bash

   bazel run //images/linux_x86_64:run
   bazel run //images/qnx_x86_64:run
   bazel run //images/autosd:run
   bazel run //images/ebclfsa_aarch64:run

The QNX and aarch64 images boot under QEMU, which needs a one-time host setup
(TUN device, bridge helper, libvirt network). Follow the QEMU runner how-to in
`runners/qemu_x86_64/README.md <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/runners/qemu_x86_64/README.md>`_ before the
first run.

Two ways to get your module onto the images
-------------------------------------------

There are two ways to make your binary part of the images:

* **As a showcase (recommended).** Bundle your binary once into the aggregate
  ``//showcases`` package; it is then deployed into **every** image
  automatically — one change covers all four platforms, and the binary is also
  offered in the interactive CLI. See :ref:`add_showcase` below.
* **Directly into each image.** Wire the binary into each image's build
  description by hand. This is **per-image work that you repeat four times**
  (once per image) and is only needed for components that are not run as a CLI
  showcase — typically a daemon. The ``datarouter`` is integrated this way; see
  how the QNX image does it in
  `images/qnx_x86_64/build/BUILD <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/images/qnx_x86_64/build/BUILD>`_ (the
  ``datarouter`` source and the ``DATAROUTER_PATH`` mapping). See
  :ref:`add_directly` below. Prefer the showcase route unless you have a reason
  not to.

.. _add_showcase:

Add a runtime showcase
----------------------
A *showcase* is the vehicle that gets your module onto the platforms: you bundle
a runnable binary, and the aggregate ``//showcases`` package is deployed into
**every** image automatically. You do this once — there is no per-platform work.

There are two patterns under `showcases/ <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/showcases>`_:

* **Standalone** (`showcases/standalone <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/showcases/standalone>`_) — bundle
  a binary that already exists in your module's repo.
* **Composed** — a small binary defined *here* that combines several modules.

**1. Define the bundle.** Add a ``score_pkg_bundle`` target. To re-use a binary
that lives in your module:

.. code-block:: python

   load("//bazel_common:bundlers.bzl", "score_pkg_bundle")

   score_pkg_bundle(
       name = "my_module",
       bins = ["@score_my_module//examples:my_example"],
       config_data = ["//showcases/standalone:my_module.score.json"],
       package_dir = "standalone",
   )

**2. Add a CLI descriptor.** Create a ``*.score.json`` next to the bundle. The
CLI auto-discovers every ``*.score.json`` deployed under ``/showcases`` and
offers it in the interactive menu, so **no code change to the CLI is required**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "name": "My Module Example",
       "description": "Demonstrates my_module at runtime",
       "apps": [
           {
               "path": "/showcases/bin/my_example",
               "args": [],
               "env": {},
               "dir": "/showcases/data/my_module"
           }
       ]
   }

**3. Register the bundle in the top-level showcase package.** Add your bundle to
the aggregate ``score_pkg_bundle`` in
`showcases/BUILD <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/showcases/BUILD>`_ so it is packaged into the images:

.. code-block:: python

   score_pkg_bundle(
       name = "showcases",
       bins = ["//showcases/cli"],
       other_package_files = [
           "//showcases/standalone:comm_pkg_files",
           # ...
           "//showcases/standalone:my_module_pkg_files",
       ],
       package_dir = "showcases",
   )

Once your bundle is part of ``//showcases``, it is reachable from
``//images/<platform>:image`` and is therefore **built by every platform CI
job** automatically.

.. _add_directly:

Add a binary directly to an image
---------------------------------

If your component is not a CLI showcase — for example a background daemon that
must always be present — you wire it straight into each image's build
description instead. Unlike the showcase route, **this is per-image work: you
repeat it for every image you target** (Linux, QNX, AutoSD, EBcLfSA).

The reference example is the ``datarouter``. In the QNX image it is added as a
source of the image target and exposed to the image's build description via a
location mapping, then placed into the filesystem by ``system.build``:

.. code-block:: python

   # images/qnx_x86_64/build/BUILD
   qnx_ifs(
       name = "init",
       srcs = [
           # ...
           "//showcases",
           "@score_logging//score/datarouter",
           "//feature_integration_tests/configs/datarouter:etc_configs",
       ],
       ext_repo_maping = {
           "BUNDLE_PATH": "$(location //showcases:showcases)",
           "DATAROUTER_PATH": "$(location @score_logging//score/datarouter:datarouter)",
       },
   )

See `images/qnx_x86_64/build/BUILD <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/images/qnx_x86_64/build/BUILD>`_ and the
matching deployment lines in
`images/qnx_x86_64/build/system.build <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/blob/main/images/qnx_x86_64/build/system.build>`_
for the full picture, and repeat the equivalent wiring in the other images you
need (`images/linux_x86_64 <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/images/linux_x86_64>`_,
`images/autosd <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/images/autosd>`_,
`images/ebclfsa_aarch64 <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/images/ebclfsa_aarch64>`_).

If your module simply cannot run on a given platform, exclude its targets via
``metadata.exclude_test_targets`` / ``metadata.extra_test_config`` in
``known_good.json`` (Step 1) rather than editing the workflow.
